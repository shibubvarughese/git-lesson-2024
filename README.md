To make a commit (version or checkpoint) of your file, follow this procedure

1. Make changes to your project that you would like to keep
2. When you have the changes, tell 'git' that you are ready to create a check point of the file using the 'git add FILENAME' command
3. Create the checkpoint of your file using 'git commit -m 'message about what you did'

To create and switch to a branch, use the command 

'git switch -c NEW_BRANCH_NAME'
